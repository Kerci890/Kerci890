About Me
Hello! I'm a student at FE Ljubljana, pursuing my passion for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Cybersecurity. Technology has always intrigued me, and Iâ€™m eager to dive deeper into how networks, systems, and security frameworks operate.

Interests
ICT & Cybersecurity: Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by how technology can be secured in an increasingly digital world. Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new developments in network security, encryption, and ethical hacking.

Sports & Outdoors: Beyond my academic life, Iâ€™m an active person who loves engaging in sports and spending time outdoors. Whether it's hiking up a scenic trail or staying active in various sports, I enjoy the balance between mental and physical activities.

Hobbies
Hiking: Iâ€™m always looking for new trails to explore, as itâ€™s a great way to disconnect from the digital world and appreciate nature.

Outdoor Adventures: Whether it's biking, running, or other outdoor activities, I love the thrill of new adventures.

Goals
To further my knowledge in ICT and Cybersecurity, with a particular focus on protecting systems and data.
Stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle by continuing to participate in sports and outdoor activities.
